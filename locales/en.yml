    why-title: Why we adapting it?
    why: In 2016, we met <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures' famous Design Sprint methodology</a>, which has as a fundamental requirement the participation of all those involved for a week. We loved the idea of starting to try it, but from our experience working with clients of large companies, we recognized that with the lack of time of the decision makers, it becomes almost impossible to get their fulltime participation in the projects.<br> <br>In this stage, we decided to adjust the activities that involve them, to only require them in those of a relevant nature where their vision is key for the future stages of the process. To date we have tested and refined the adaptation successfully in many projects and instead we want to make this learning available to the community and invite them to share their experiences with us as well.

    title: C칩mo funciona
    subtitle: Antes de poner en pr치ctica un Design Sprint se deben definir algunas partes claves. Es recomendable tomar al menos un par de semanas para hacer investigaci칩n tanto con usuarios como con el negocio. Se puede hacer mediante entrevistas personales con usuarios finales y stakeholders.
